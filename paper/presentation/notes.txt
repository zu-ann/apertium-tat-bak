==Intro==

* Some history:
** Apertium is a pretty successful platform for making RBMT systems 
     particularly between closely related languages
** But so far we don't have any released pairs with Turkic languages,
     released means that they've got adequate (> 80%) coverage and 
     pass quality controls

* Objectives: 
** Create a pedagogical example for translating Turkic
     languages with Apertium for use in a workshop
** Show that systems between morphologically complex languages
     can be successful in Apertium (previous failures: sme-fin, sme-smj, ...)

==System architecture==

===Tools===

* HFST (lexc + twol): Analysis and generation
* Constraint Grammar: Disambiguation
* Apertium: Lexical disambiguation and transfer

===Fitting them together===

* Figure 1.

==Development process==

* The development process can be characterised as manual.

===Previous experience===

* Turkish--Azerbaijani*
* Turkish--Kyrgyz*

[* Funded by Google Summer of Code 2011]

===Team===

* Francis Tyers (morphotactics, morphophonology)
* Jonathan North Washington (morphophonology, morphotactics)
* Ilnar Salimzyanov (morphotactics, lexicon)
* Rustam Batalov (lexicon)

* + Input from the apertium-turkic mailing list (~ 25 subscribers,
      interested in Turkic--Turkic machine translation)

==Evaluation==

* Coverage 
* tt/ba over time

* Word Error Rate

==Observations==

* Importance of unified tagsets, and grammatical representations:
    - If something is the same, tag it the same.
    - Otherwise you spend a lot of time on useless `transfer'
      (e.g. ky, ~50 transfer rules, around 4 `real' rules)
* Building the transducers and bilingual dictionary at the same time is good
* Much easier to work with new code than adapt existing code

==Future work==

=== Current projects ===

* Chuvash--Turkish  (Oksana Antonova, Hèctor Alòs i Font, Francis Tyers)
* Tatar--Kazakh*    (Ilnar Salimyzanov, Jonathan North Washington)
* Tatar--Turkish*   (Ramil Aglyamzanov)
* Turkmen--Turkish* (Yasin Gülbahçe, Gianluca Grossi, Francis Tyers)

=== Turkic languages in Apertium ===

* staging = tur-aze*, tur-kir*
* nursery = tuk-tur, tat-bak, tat-tur
* incubator = chv-tur, kaz-tat, kaz-kir, chv-tat,

          & atv & aze & bak & chv & kaz & kir & nog & sah & tat & tuk & tur & tuv & uig & uzb
